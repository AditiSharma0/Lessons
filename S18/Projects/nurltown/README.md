# Nurltown: an machine learning powered ecosystem simulator

The happy, sunshiney little village of Nurltown, where virtual creatures (nurlets) run around, have outdoor potlucks,
and **fight to the death.**

## Objectives
* Design a 2D game engine to run the simulation
* Develop neural networks to give your nurlet a brain (itâ€™s ALIIIIIVE!!)
* Implement evolutionary algorithms to teach your nurlets how to eat, grow, multiply, and defend against their enemies

## Tools & Components
* python 3
* virtualenv for sandboxing python
* numpy numerical computation package
* scipy library for scientific computing
* pyGame library for game development
* our very own custom NEAT implementation
