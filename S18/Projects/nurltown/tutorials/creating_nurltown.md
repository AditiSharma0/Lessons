# Exploring Pygame

In this tutorial, we will be exloring the basics of game development using the Pygame platform.
We will be creating a 2D game world, populating it with entities (creatures, barriers and food), and using that to 
understand some key concepts of game development such **the game loop**, **rendering**, and **game logic**.

For this introduction to pygame, we will be roughly following
[this youtube video series by sentdex](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujOTNg17LjI&list=PLQVvvaa0QuDdLkP8MrOXLe_rKuf6r80KO).
As we progress through the components of Pygame, I will be adding further commentary to develop our understanding of
general programming and game development. That said, if you feel confident, definitely use the video series as an
extra resource to enrich your learning.

**NOTE:** Below is a step-by-step development of our understanding of pygame, where we will be discussing small
parts of the entire file at a time.

```python
import math
