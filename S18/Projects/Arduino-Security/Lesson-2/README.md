# Meet-Up #2 Agenda:

**Objective**: join the slack, get your Arduinos, and create a basic button and LED program.

## 1. Setup
* [Make sure you have the Arduino IDE.](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software)
* Join the Slack! (Contact a club executive about joining).
* Check out Arduino example code [on their site.](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/BuiltInExamples)
* [Millis() information](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/language/functions/time/millis/) (for challenge 1).

## 2. Here is your Arduino!

## 3. Coding
**Challenge 1:**
Using a push button and Millis(), create a program that will turn on an LED if the button is exactly 1 per second for 3 seconds.

**Challenge 2:**
Using multiple push buttons, create a program that will turn on an LED only if the push buttons are pressed in the correct order.
