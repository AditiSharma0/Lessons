# Nurltown: an machine learning powered ecosystem simulator

The happy, sunshiney little village of Nurltown, where virtual creatures (nurlets) run around, have outdoor potlucks,
and **fight to the death.**

## Objectives
* Design a 2D game engine to run the simulation
* Develop neural networks to give your nurlet a brain (itâ€™s ALIIIIIVE!!)
* Implement evolutionary algorithms to teach your nurlets how to eat, grow, multiply, and defend against their enemies

### Tools & Components
* python 3
* virtualenv for sandboxing python
* numpy numerical computation package
* scipy library for scientific computing
* pyGame library for game development
* our very own custom NEAT implementation

## Installation

### Installing `python3`
#### On Mac OS X


1. First, you must install the Homebrew package manager. Open a terminal and run

`$ ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"`

2. Insert the Homebrew directory at the top of your **PATH** environment variable. You can do this by adding
the following line at the bottom of your `~/.profile` file

`export PATH=/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:$PATH`

3. `brew install python`

Note: The python installation will also use the `pip` python package manager. We will use this to install the python utilities
and libraries that we will need.

### Installing `virtualenv`
1. `pip install --upgrade pip`
